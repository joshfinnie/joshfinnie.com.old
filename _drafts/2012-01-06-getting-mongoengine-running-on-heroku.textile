h2. The Process

p. I have recently been playing around with Heroku and one of my most recent pain points was getting MongoEngine properly working. Heroku does a very nice job at making it easy for you to addon MongoDB. I am not going to get into the inner workings of Heroku on this post as they do a great job here. However, once you have added MongoDB to your Heroku app, you have this line of code in your config file: @MONGOHQ_URL => mongodb://username:password@staff.mongohq.com:port/db@.

{% highlight python %}from flask import Flask
 app = Flask(__name__)
 	
@app.route("/")
from mongoengine import connect

database = urlparse(os.environ.get('MONGOHQ_URL'))

connect(database.path[1:], 
        host=database.hostname,
        port=database.port, 
        username=database.username,
        password=database.password)
{% endhighlight %}
