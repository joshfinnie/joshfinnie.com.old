<h2>A Coder's Lifestyle <small>written: October  4, 2011</small></h2>
<h2>Background</h2>
<p>While studying for my undergraduate degree, I briefly dabbled in programming as amajor. I first started in the Computer Science department, but soon felt out-of-place. The introduction class was basically a &#8220;Convert this C++, which you should already know, into Java.&#8221; I felt entirely lost. Luckily, moving tothe Computer Engineering department gave me the base I needed.</p>
<p>Jump forward 5 years of undergraduate education, and I graduated with a bachelors in Economics. I don&#8217;t know why, maybe it was the easy way out, but I never felt like I could succeed as an computer scientist.</p>
<h2>Today</h2>
<p>Today, I work for a large insurance company as a trainer; almost as removed from a programmer as you can get. But I still feel the urge to create things through code. That is why I have been working on so many pet projects; I just don&#8217;t have enough hours in the day.</p>
<h2>How to Succeed</h2>
<p>I am not sure I know the answer to the question, &#8220;how to succeed?&#8221; And more importantly, I really need to sit down and define what succeed is, but each night I learn another thing about a programming language that I didn&#8217;t know before and hopefully soon enough I will be someone who can hold their weight on sites like <a href="http://stackoverflow.com">StackOverflow</a>.</p>
<p>Here are my tips that I have learned so far:</p>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Don&#8217;t over extend yourself</strong> This is especially true if you have a full-time job that is not programming related. I find that I get some grandious idea while at work, get home and bang it out. All this does is lead to frustration when it doesn&#8217;t work and it&#8217;s already 1AM. Start slow.</li>
	<li><strong>Stick to one technology at a time.</strong> Everywhere you read there is going to be some up-and-coming technology that everyone wants to use. When you are not a full-time programmer, there is no time for you to really experiment with new technologies. You need to make sure your footing is solid before moving forward.</li>
	<li><strong>Finish something.</strong> It is an amazing feeling when you have finished a program to the point that it works. It is a great boost that you can use to get more excited about programming your next project. No matter how small it is, finish something.</li>
</ul>
<p>I am sure I will have more thoughts as I get back into bloggin, but I thought this would be a good step in the right direction. Let me know what you think.</p>
